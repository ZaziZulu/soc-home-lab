# soc-home-lab
Hands-on SOC home lab built in Microsoft Azure to practice virtual networking, VM configuration, firewall management, and security monitoring.

## What I Did

- Created a Virtual Network (VNet) to simulate a secure environment.
- Deployed a Virtual Machine (VM) and connected it to the VNet.
- Configured Network Security Groups (NSG) and managed firewall rules.
- Turned off NSG and VM firewall to simulate vulnerabilities.
- Explored Microsoft Sentinel for monitoring and alerting.

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Azure
- Virtual Network and Virtual Machine
- Network Security Groups
- Microsoft Sentinel
- Wireshark (for packet analysis)
- PowerShell, Bash, KQL (for automation and querying)

## Learning Outcomes

- Understanding Azure network infrastructure and security.
- Practiced configuring and managing security controls.
- Simulated threat scenarios to enhance incident detection and response skills.
- Gained familiarity with Microsoft Sentinel SIEM tool.

## Next Steps

- Integrate more automated alerting and incident response.
- Expand lab with additional endpoints and logging tools.
- Continue learning Security+ certification topics.
